# Hello World Example

A basic CircuitPython example for the Metro M4 Airlift Lite that demonstrates:
- Serial output
- LED control
- Basic program structure

## What it does

This example:
1. Prints "Hello, World!" to the serial console
2. Blinks the built-in LED on pin D13
3. Continues running in an infinite loop

## How to use

1. Copy `code.py` to your `CIRCUITPY` drive
2. Open a serial monitor (115200 baud)
3. Watch the LED blink and see the serial output

## Expected output

```
Hello, World!
Welcome to Metro M4 Airlift Lite!
Starting LED blink demo...
LED ON
LED OFF
LED ON
LED OFF
...
```

## Hardware

- Metro M4 Airlift Lite board
- Built-in LED (no additional hardware needed)
